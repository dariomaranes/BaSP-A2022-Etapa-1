### Week 01

I prototyped the interface of Trackgenix web system using Figma.

### Week 02

I developed the basic HTML structure of the site using the best practice.
I used white icons downloaded from the Figma project and due to the problem they will not be displayed in the browser.

### Week 03

I applied CSS to HTML structure and did structural changes on it relationed with the styles.

### Week 04

I implemented Flexbox CSS properties and made structural changes to adapt flex.

### Week 05

I corrected some Flexbox errors and made 6 (six) JS exercises with these important issues:
- _Variables and operators_
- _Strings_
- _Arrays_
- _If-else_
- _For_
- _Functions_

### Week 06

I created login and employee-signup HTML and CSS files, and then I applied JS to them creating one JS file for each one.
Also I applied JS to contact form in index.html file.

### Week 07

I continued working with login and employee-sign-up JS files. I add requests to API using fetch.
If you want to try to login, you can only access successfully using this credentials:
email: rose@radiumrocket.com password: BaSP2022.
Finally I replace login and employee-sign-up alerts for modals.
